IfcOpenHouse
============

IfcOpenHouse [http://blog.ifcopenshell.org/2012/11/say-hi-to-ifcopenhouse.html] is a building model created entirely by means of writing lines of code that generate the individual building products and its representations. IfcOpenHouse is an IFC(-SPF) file [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes] and generated by using an open source software library for working with IFC files, called IfcOpenShell [http://ifcopenshell.org].
